# Introduction # 

Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological cancer in France and in western countries (1-3).  Thanks to an early diagnosis (75% of the cases in the International Federation of Gynecologists-Obstetricians (FIGO) stage I or II), mortality is constantly decreasing (4, 7). However, 10 to 15% of these patients will recur (15-17) with a death rate of 25% at 5 years (10,14). 
 
Recidivism can occur in several ways, in isolation or in multiple ways. Local, ganglionic, metastatic recurrences are differentiated at a distance or in the form of peritoneal carcinomatosis. 

Among these different modalities, local recurrences have already been published and are associated with a decrease in survival with prognostic factors that are difficult to identify (18). 

Recurrences in the form of peritoneal carcinomatosis have, to our knowledge, never been specifically studied. There are no data in the literature on their predictive factors and on the prognosis of concerned patients. These data could help guide the clinician in their management. 

Our objective was to determine specific risk factors for recurrence with peritoneal carcinomatosis and to evaluate the prognosis of these patients in comparison with patients presenting a recurrence without carcinosis and those having not recidivated.

## Characteristics of the study ##

This is a multicenter retrospective study based on the analysis of the FRANCOGYN research group database of 11 French hospitals (Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital Center). Paris, CHU Bichat, Paris, Georges-François Leclerc Center, Dijon, Intercommunal Hospital Center of Créteil, CHU Jeanne de Flandre and Oscar Lambret Center, Lille, CHU Jean Verdier, Bondy, CHU of Reims, Rennes, Tours, CHU Tenon , Paris) as well as the database of the SENTI-ENDO study (19). The research protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the French National College of Gynecologists and Obstetrician (CEROG 2014 - GYN-020). 

These databases included all patients treated with primary surgery for an endometrial malignancy between July 1999 and February 2017, sarcomas were excluded. The main characteristics of the patients included were extracted from their medical charts: age, BMI, medical and surgical history, surgical procedure, 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage [13], final pathological analysis, treatment received.


## Initial management ##

Patients were treated according to the recommendations in force (10,25). Initial surgery included at least one hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy / sentinel lymph node procedure or pelvic or lumbar aortic dissection. Patients from the Senti-Endo study all had research pelvic sentinel lymph node with pelvic lymphadenectomy completed with aortic lymphadenectomy if sentinel lymph node biopsy or pelvic lymphadenectomy were positive (19). The indication of adjuvant treatment (brachytherapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) was asked in the multidisciplinary collaborative meeting according to the recommendations (9,24, 25). 
In accordance with INCa and ESMO recommendations (24,25,27), patients were reviewed every 3 to 4 months in the first two years, then every 6 months up to 5 years. 

## Modality of recurrence ##

Patients could present either local recurrence when the damage was limited to the vaginal or centropelvic fundus, or lymph node, or metastatic, which corresponds to a recurrence at a distance, or peritoneal carcinomatosis. Patients could have several associated forms of recurrence. The diagnosis of local recurrence was confirmed by a biopsy. The diagnosis of distant recurrence was made by performing an adapted imaging test according to the signs of clinical calls. 
The patients were divided into three groups according to the type of recurrence defined as follows: 
• "Recurrent with carcinomatosis" group: recurrence in the form of peritoneal carcinomatosis associated or not with another form of recurrence 
• "Recurrence without carcinosis" group: Recurrence without peritoneal carcinomatosis. 
• Group "Absence of recidivism": Absence of recurrence during the follow-up. 

## Management of recidivism ##

Management of patients with recurrence was discussed and validated according to the recommendations (14,27). Depending on the case, a proposal for chemotherapy, radiotherapy, brachytherapy, hormonal therapy, surgery or an association of these techniques could be formulated. Patients who could not benefit from specific treatment for recidivism nevertheless received supportive care and comfort adapted to their general condition. 

## Statistical Analysis ##

To compare categorical variables, we used the Chi2 test or Fisher's exact test when Chi2 validity conditions were not met. To compare a continuous variable with a categorical variable, we used the Student's test. 
Multivariate analysis was done with multiple logistic regression taking into account factors whose degree of significance was less than 0.20 when univariate analysis. The date of the latest news is the date of last contact with the patient. The survival without recurrence was calculated in months, from the date of the initial surgery to the date of the diagnosis of recidivism. Overall and specific survivals were calculated from the date of the initial surgery to the date of death. Total survivals after recidivism were calculated from the date of recidivism to the date of death or the latest news. The survival curves were performed according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons with survival curves were calculated with the Log-Rank test. The test results were considered significant when the p value was less than 0.05. The data was managed by an Excel® database (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Statistical analyzes were performed on program R 3-5.1 available online (https://cran.r-project.org/).

Population of the study 

The flow diagram of the study is presented in Figure 1.

Over the study period, 1466 patients were included, 257 patients (17.5%) had a recurrence of their CE, of which: • 63 in the form of peritoneal carcinomatosis (ie 24.5% of patients with recurrence), including 39 as isolated peritoneal carcinomatosis and 24 as peritoneal carcinomatosis associated with other forms of recurrence. 194 as recurrence without peritoneal carcinomatosis (13.2% of patients in charge of a CE), including 91 distant metastases, 54 isolated local recurrences, 46 ganglionic recurrences, 3 recurrences associated with remote recidivism. 

The 2009 FIGO stage was more advanced in the recurrence with carcinomatosis group than in the recurrence without carcinomatosis group with a FIGO 2009 III-IV stage rate of 57.14% vs 37.11% (p = 0.0041). ). The difference in type 2 rates was at the limit of significance in the recurrence with carcinosis group compared to the recurrence without carcinomatosis group (42.9% vs. 28.9%), p = 0.056. There was no no difference between the groups "recurrence with carcinomatosis" and "recurrence without carcinomatosis" for the grade.
The level of risk according to the ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO 2016 classification was significantly higher in the recurrence with carcinosis group than in the recurrence without carcinosis groups, with "high risk" rates, respectively of 81.0%. vs 65.5% (p = 0.0311)
